    <h1>Today I ate tacos for lunch. They were really just alright.</h1>

    <p>The specific tacos I ate were carne asada and a vegetarian one which were both interesting but not enough flavor. My favorite tacos are actually at this small place in Chelsea Market. I'll probably go get those later.</p>
